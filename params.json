{"name":"Dynamic form","body":"DynamicForm\r\n===========\r\n\r\nDynamicForm holds a few helpers method to help you deal with your Rails3 models, they are:\r\n\r\n* `input(record, method, options = {})`\r\n* `form(record, options = {})`\r\n* `error_message_on(object, method, options={})`\r\n* `error_messages_for(record, options={})`\r\n\r\nIt also adds `f.error_messages` and `f.error_messages_on` to your form builders.\r\n\r\nRead `/lib/action_view/helpers/dynamic_form.rb` for details of each method.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDynamicErrors\r\n=============\r\n\r\nDynamicForm also includes DynamicErrors, which is a port of the custom-err-messages plugin,\r\nbut built to work with Rails3. It gives you the option to not have your custom validation\r\nerror message prefixed with the attribute name. Ordinarily, if you have, say:\r\n\r\n    validates_acceptance_of :accepted_terms, :message => 'Please accept the terms of service'\r\n\r\nYou'll get the following error message:\r\n\r\n    Accepted terms Please accept the terms of service\r\n\r\nThis plugin allows you to omit the attribute name for specific messages. All you have to do\r\nis begin the message with a '^' character. Example:\r\n\r\n    validates_acceptance_of :accepted_terms, :message => '^Please accept the terms of service'\r\n    \r\nNigel Ramsay added the ability to specify a proc to generate the message.\r\n\r\n    validates_presence_of :assessment_answer_option_id, \r\n      :message => Proc.new { |aa| \"#{aa.label} (#{aa.group_label}) is required\" }\r\n\r\n    which gives an error message like: Rate (Accuracy) is required\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nDynamicForm can be installed as a gem in your `Gemfile`:\r\n\r\n    gem 'dynamic_form'\r\n    \r\nor as a plugin by running this command:\r\n\r\n    rails plugin install git://github.com/joelmoss/dynamic_form.git\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2010 David Heinemeier Hansson, released under the MIT license\r\n","tagline":"Helpers to deal with your model backed forms in Rails3","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
